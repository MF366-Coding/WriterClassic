You can create an automated script with Python on scripts/auto.wscript inside the WriterClassic folder.
Having file.wclassic and file.wclassic.wscript on the same location (where the last one is a Python structurated file) will cause some special behavior, eh eh!
You can lock and unlock your window. Leaving it unlocked allows for anyone to resize it but while it's locked, only WriterClassic can resize itself.
Before v10.0.0, WriterClassic didn't have Undo/Redo options. Thankfully, it has those features now.
WriterClassic has a super special command menu that can be called by using Ctrl + Shift + P.
If you right click on your text editor 6 times, you get access to 2 super special options.
Tips and Tricks are fully randomized. I bet you knew that already though.
