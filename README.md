# Writer Classic
Writer Classic's GitHub repository.

Writer Classic is a small Python file that, together with some config files, bring to the user a whole new text editor experience. :thinking:

**IMPORTANT INFO!**

Writer works in Windows, MacOS and Linux, but there are some bugs in menus and features in both Windows and Mac.

Thanks for visiting this repository. :+1:

I also would love if you waste some time testing Writer Classic or just exploring this GitHub repository.

# Installing Writer Classic
To install Writer, you can choose between 2 ways of installing.

## Stable Releases
Choose this instalation method for a non-crashing environment.

### 1. Downloading
Go to https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/releases/latest to get the latest release and download the <code>*.zip</code> file.

### 2. Extraction
With the file on your computer, extract it to a folder you have or to the same location of the zipped file.

All files and folders inside the zipped one **must** be on the same location!

### 3. Running the program
Go to the right folder.

#### For Linux and MacOS
Type `python3 WriterClassic.py` and you can now use Writer Classic.

This app only runs os Python 3, so using the command `python WriterClassic.py` won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

#### For Windows
For Windows, the setup might be a bit more complicated.

The Python app has been converted into an executable for easier acess.

Download the zipped folder in Releases (only v4.2.1+ have the Windows converted executable).

The zipped folder should contain several folders and *.py files.

Extract **EVERYTHING** to a different folder.

Then run the executable named `WriterClassic.exe`.

Note running the file does **NOT** install any shortcuts or dependencies. You mustn't remove anything from the now extracted folder!

##### Additional Setup: Start Menu Shortcut
**NOTE:** *this doesn't reffer to the "Pin in Start Menu", however feel free to use that one if you prefer.*

To make a Start Menu shortcut, you must follow the following steps:

1. Open two windows of **File Explorer**.
2. In one of them, go to the location `C:\Users\<NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`, where "`<NAME>`" refers to **YOUR** Windows username.
3. In the other File Explorer window, go to the folder where you extracted WriterClassic's Windows-only zipped folder.
4. Now, place the windows side-by-side (not necessary but makes the process a bit easier).
5. Finally, and most important of all, **while holding `Ctrl` and `Shift` at the same time**, grab the `WriterClassic.exe` file and throw it into the `StartMenu` folder.
6. You should probably rename the file to "`WriterClassic`" for easier acess, that is, without the file extension (because it's a shortcut - the extension is hidden in Windows by default and is not `*.exe`).
7. You can, afterwards, make shortcuts in Desktop, Pin in Start Menu, Taskbar, as you wish...

## Unstable Releases
Maybe you are a developer who wants acess to the latest update to Writer...

### 1. Clone the repo
Open the Terminal and use <code>git clone https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic.git</code>.

However, that will only work if you have Git installed on your device...

### 2. Running the program
Go to the folder where the repo was cloned.

#### For Linux and MacOS
Type <code>python3 WriterClassic.py</code> and you can now use Writer Classic.

This app only runs os Python 3, so using the command <code>python WriterClassic.py</code> won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

#### For Windows
Follow the steps in [here](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic#additional-setup-start-menu-shortcut) after cloning the repo and getting everything set.
