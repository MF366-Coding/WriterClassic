# Installing Writer Classic (for people exploring the repository) 
To install Writer, you can choose between 2 ways of installing.

## 1. Downloading
Go to https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/releases/latest to get the latest release and download the <code>*.zip</code> file.

## 2. Extraction
With the file on your computer, extract it to a folder you have or to the same location of the zipped file.

All files and folders inside the zipped one **must** be on the same location!

## 3. Running the program
Go to the right folder.

### For Linux and MacOS
Use:

```python3 WriterClassic.py```

...and you can now use Writer Classic.

This app only runs os Python 3, so using the command `python WriterClassic.py` won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

### For Windows
For Windows, just run the Setup Wizard and you are good to go! 

# What do I need to be able to be able to use Writer Classic?
You need:

* [X] Python 3 (Comes with MacOS and Linux, usually | Requires installation on Windows, unless you use the executable version of WriterClassic)

* [X] requests (Python3 Module)

* [X] simple_webbrowser (Python3 Module made by me) 

* [X] the `data` folder that comes with WriterClassic

* [X] the `config` folder that comes with WriterClassic

* [X] the `user_data` folder that comes with WriterClassic

The `plugins` folder is totally optional.

## Editing
You can do regular file editing like **opening**, **saving** and simply typing!

To open a plain text file, go to **File** > **Open...** and pick the file you want to open.

To save a document, go to **File** > **Save...** and name the file. Pick its location and click Save. Boom!

## Sparkles and sparkles
To change the default window size of WriterClassic, go to **Appearance** > **Window dimensions** and follow the instructions.

To pick a theme, just go to **Appearance** and pick, from Default and Modern themes, the one you like the best.

## Plugins
Enjoy default plugins and custom plugins.

This powerful feature... I'll let you explore it by yourself...

## Internet
The Internet plugin, on the tab next to Plugins...

Search with Google, Ecosia, Bing, Yahoo, YouTube and much more directly from your favorite text editor.

You can also go to an URL.

## Settings and info
Customize your language. Go ahead, pick yours!

Yours isn't available? Consider creating your own custom translation or report it to Issues as an enhancement.

You can also enjoy WriterClassic offline, by just changing one simple setting: Checking for Updates on Startup. If ON, you gotta be online. If OFF, doesn't matter where you are and mostly, if you have internet connection, because WriterClassic won't need it to launch.

### Command Menu
You can press **Ctrl + W** (check the Shotcuts area for more info) to open this **hidden** feature.

In here, you can type a command and click 'OK' and something will happen.
