Writer Classic is a rather small Python project that brings to the user a whole new text editing experience. :thinking:

## Welcome...
...and thanks for visiting this repository. :heart:

I also would love if you waste some time testing Writer Classic or just exploring this GitHub repository.

## Important info
**VERY IMPORTANT!**
- LICENSE -> https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/blob/main/LICENSE

# Installing Writer Classic
To install Writer, you can choose between 2 ways of installing.

## Stable Releases
Choose this instalation method for a non-crashing environment.

### 1. Downloading
Go to https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/releases/latest to get the latest release and download the <code>*.zip</code> file.

### 2. Extraction
With the file on your computer, extract it to a folder you have or to the same location of the zipped file.

All files and folders inside the zipped one **must** be on the same location!

### 3. Running the program
Go to the right folder.

For MacOS or Windows use:
```python3 WriterClassic.py```

...and you can now use Writer Classic.

For Windows do:
```python WriterClassic.py```

This app only runs os Python 3!

## Unstable Releases
Maybe you are a developer who wants acess to the latest update to Writer...

### 1. Clone the repo
Open the Terminal and clone the repository.

However, that will only work if you have Git installed on your device...

### 2. Running the program
Go to the folder where the repo was cloned.

#### For Linux and MacOS
Use the following command on your commandline:
```python3 WriterClassic.py```

This app only runs os Python 3, so using the command <code>python WriterClassic.py</code> won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

#### For Windows
Follow the steps in [here](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic#additional-setup-start-menu-shortcut) after cloning the repo and getting everything set.

## Editing
You can do regular file editing like **opening**, **saving** and simply typing!

To open a plain text file, go to **File** > **Open...** and pick the file you want to open.

To save a document, go to **File** > **Save...** and name the file. Pick its location and click Save. Boom!

## Sparkles and sparkles
To change the default window size of WriterClassic, go to **Appearance** > **Window dimensions** and follow the instructions.

To pick a theme, just go to **Appearance** and pick, from Default and Modern themes, the one you like the best.

## Plugins
Enjoy default plugins and custom plugins.

This powerful feature... I'll let you explore it by yourself...

## Internet
The Internet plugin, on the tab next to Plugins...

Search with Google, Ecosia, Bing, Yahoo, YouTube and much more directly from your favorite text editor.

You can also go to an URL.

## Settings and info
Customize your language. Go ahead, pick yours!

Yours isn't available? Consider creating your own custom translation or report it to Issues as an enhancement.

You can also enjoy WriterClassic offline, by just changing one simple setting: Checking for Updates on Startup. If ON, you gotta be online. If OFF, doesn't matter where you are and mostly, if you have internet connection, because WriterClassic won't need it to launch.

### Command Menu
You can press **Ctrl + W** (check the Shotcuts area for more info) to open this **hidden** feature.

In here, you can type a command and click 'OK' and something will happen.
