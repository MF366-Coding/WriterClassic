# Installing Writer Classic (for people exploring the repository)
To install Writer, you can choose between 2 ways of installing.

## For Windows
Go to https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/releases/latest to get the latest release and download the <code>*.exe</code> file.

Then, run it! 

## For Linux and MacOS (or if you simply want the source)
Do the same thing but for the source code. Either run the main Python file or compile it yourself.

All files and folders inside the zipped one **must** be on the same location!

### Comamnd for running
Use:

```python3 WriterClassic.py```

...and you can now use Writer Classic.

This app only runs on Python 3, so using the command `python WriterClassic.py` won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

# What do I need to be able to be able to use Writer Classic?
You need:

* [X] Python 3 (Comes with MacOS and Linux, usually | Requires installation on Windows, unless you use the executable version of WriterClassic)

* [X] requests (Python3 Module)

* [X] simple_webbrowser (Python3 Module made by me) 

* [X] all the datafiles that come with WriterClassic

Yours isn't available? Consider creating your own custom translation or report it to Issues as an enhancement.

You can also enjoy WriterClassic offline, by just changing one simple setting: Checking for Updates on Startup. If ON, you gotta be online. If OFF, doesn't matter where you are and mostly, if you have internet connection, because WriterClassic won't need it to launch.
