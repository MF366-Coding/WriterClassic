# WriterClassic
Writer Classic's GitHub repository.

Great news! Writer Classic has arrived to GitHub! :tada:

Writer Classic is a small Python file that, together with some config files, bring to the user a whole new text editor experience. :thinking:

IMPORTANT INFO: Due to Python resources that are only available on Linux, Writer Classic is Linux only. :cry:

This is a garage project that is constantly growing, so I am moving to GitHub.
