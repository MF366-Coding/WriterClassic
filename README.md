# Installing Writer Classic (for people exploring the repository)
To install Writer, you can choose between 2 ways of installing.

## For Windows
Go to https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic/releases/latest to get the latest release and download the <code>*.exe</code> file.

Then, run it! 

## For Linux and MacOS (or if you simply want the source)
Clone the repo or download as a zip file.

### Command for running
Use:

```python3 WriterClassic.py```

...and you can now use Writer Classic.

This app only runs on Python 3, so using the command `python WriterClassic.py` won't work (in Unix based OSes, <code>python</code> is Python 2).

# What do I need to be able to be able to use Writer Classic?
You need:

* [X] Python 3 (Comes with MacOS and Linux, usually | Requires installation on Windows, unless you use the executable version of WriterClassic)

* [X] every module in `requirements.txt`

* [X] all the datafiles that come with WriterClassic

## Small information
If you want to redistribute this software, you need its LICENSE: this is **mandatory**!

# Let me know of any bug you find

# Help 
## Editing
You can do regular file editing like **opening**, **saving** and simply typing!

To open a plain text file, go to **File** > **Open...** and pick the file you want to open.

To save a document, go to **File** > **Save...** and name the file. Pick its location and click Save. Boom!

## Sparkles and sparkles

Yours isn't available? Consider creating your own custom translation or report it to Issues as an enhancement.

You can also enjoy WriterClassic offline, by just changing one simple setting: Checking for Updates on Startup. If ON, you gotta be online. If OFF, doesn't matter where you are and mostly, if you have internet connection, because WriterClassic won't need it to launch.

### Command Menu

In here, you can type a command and click 'OK' and something will happen.
