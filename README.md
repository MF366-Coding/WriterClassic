### Great news! Writer Classic has arrived to GitHub! :tada:

Writer Classic is a small Python file that, together with some config files, bring to the user a whole new text editor experience. :smile:

This is a garage project that is constantly growing, so I am moving to GitHub.

By the way, thanks for visiting this repository. :+1:

I also would love if you waste some time testing Writer Classic or just exploring this GitHub repository.
